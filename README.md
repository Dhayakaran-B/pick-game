- Two players take turns rolling a virtual dice.
- The number rolled is added to the **current score**.
- A player can choose to:
  - **Roll again** to increase their current score (risking it all),
  - Or **Hold** to add the current score to their **total score** and pass the turn.
- **If a player rolls a 1**, they lose all points accumulated during that turn and the turn passes to the other player.
- The **first player to reach 100 or more points** wins the game.
